@doc Triq is a QuickCheck library for Erlang that works similar to PropEr and
QuviQ eqc. The easiest way to integrate it in your tests is to write properties
as you're used, replace the header include with that of triq, and then add the
<tt>-triq(eunit).</tt> attribute in the module. This will generate the needed
EUnit glue in order to test the properties anytime you run EUnit.
Alternatively, you can run <tt>rebar triq</tt> or <tt>rebar qc</tt> (given
correct <tt>rebar.config</tt> settings).
